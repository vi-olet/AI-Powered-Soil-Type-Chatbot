# AI-Powered-Soil-Type-Chatbot


A command-line AI chatbot that answers questions about soil types at a specified location (default: Iowa, USA). It fetches soil data from the [SoilGrids API](https://rest.isric.org/soilgrids/v2.0/) and uses a **mock LLM** (predefined responses simulating a large language model) to provide conversational answers. The project is designed to integrate with real LLMs (e.g., Hugging Face, Gemini) when API connectivity is available, making it a lightweight AI prototype for agricultural applications.

## Features
- Fetches soil type for a given latitude/longitude (default: 42.0, -93.5, Central Iowa).
- Responds to questions like "What's the soil type at my field?" or "Is the soil good for corn?" using mock LLM responses.
- Operates offline with Chernozem as the fallback soil type if SoilGrids is unavailable.
- Simple, terminal-based interface for AI-driven soil queries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soil-chatbot.git
   cd soil-chatbot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python soil_chatbot.py
   ```

## Usage
- Run `python soil_chatbot.py`.
- At the prompt, ask questions like:
  - "What's the soil type at my field?"
  - "Is the soil good for corn?"
- Type `quit` to exit.
- If offline, the mock LLM uses Chernozem as the default soil type.

## Example Output
```
Fetching soil data...
Soil type: Chernozem
Ask about the soil at your field (or 'quit'): What's the soil type at my field?
Hey, your Iowa field has Chernozem soilâ€”rich and fertile, great for crops like soybeans or corn!
Ask about the soil at your field (or 'quit'): Is the soil good for corn?
The Chernozem soil in your field is awesome for most crops, like corn or soybeans, due to its nutrient-rich profile. What are you planting?
```
